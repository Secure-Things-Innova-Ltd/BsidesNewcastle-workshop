Understanding the pinout of the Raspberry Pi Pico is essential for effective project development. The Pico features 40 pins, including power, ground, and 26 multi-function GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins.

For a detailed visual reference, you can refer to the official [Raspberry Pi Pico Pinout Diagram](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/Pico-R3-A4-Pinout.pdf) available in the Raspberry Pi Pico Datasheet. This diagram provides a comprehensive overview of each pin's function, including power, ground, and GPIO assignments.
